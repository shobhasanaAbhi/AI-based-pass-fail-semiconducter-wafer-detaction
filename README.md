# AI-BASED-PASS-FAIL-SEMICONDUCTOR-WAFER-USING-IMAGE

This project is a machine learning web application that classifies semiconductor wafer map images as **Pass** (no defects) or **Fail** (defective) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built with TensorFlow and deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, it leverages the WM-811K dataset to detect defect patterns in semiconductor wafers.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Automate the classification of semiconductor wafer maps to identify defect-free (Pass) or defective (Fail) wafers.
- **Dataset**: [WM-811K Wafer Map Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qingyi/wm811k-wafer-map) (CC0-1.0 license).
- **Model**: CNN trained on 64x64 grayscale wafer map images (stacked to 3 channels) for binary classification (Pass/Fail).
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud for seamless interaction.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for demonstrating AI-driven defect detection in semiconductor manufacturing, suitable for portfolios or educational content.
